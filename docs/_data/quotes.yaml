    Alison is passionate about everything HR, training and ultimately people. I’ve worked with Alison whilst I’ve been in two separate roles and I am delighted to have her advice, guidance and support within Movo. 
    
    I was excited when Alison set up her own business and even more so when we agreed she would support our business. HR and Training for your staff are crucial ingredients to a successful business and Alison acts as our critical friend. 
    
    I cannot recommend Alison highly enough. Alison is our go to person when we really need honest and open advice and when we want to put in place the very best we can for our employees.
